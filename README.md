# DjangoProject
Going through the Django intro tutorial.

<b>This site comes from the Django Starting tutorial.</b><br>
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/">Which can be found here.</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>The intention here was for me to get comfortable working within an established framwork for the web. <br>
I chose Django because Python is a great learning language that I have more experience in then Ruby or PHP.</p>
